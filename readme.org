#+DESCRIPTION: R7RS compliant scheme in Rust
+ source code: [[https://hg.rwest.io/scm2]]
  - [[https://github.com/richardwesthaver/scm2][github mirror]]


This is the second iteration of my series of PL research projects. See
[[https://rwest.io/projects/scm1.html][scm1]] for our initial implementation.

=scm2= is a [[https://small.r7rs.org/attachment/r7rs.pdf][R7RS]] compliant implementation of [[https://www.scheme.org/][scheme]]. It is much more
usable than =scm1= and has no style or dependency restrictions. We
make use of various libraries available in the Rust ecosystem and
write in a reader-friendly manner.

Here are the goals for =scm1=:
- R7RS compliant
- Cross-platform support (Linux/Win/Mac/Web)
- Parser-Generator driven (lalrpop)
- Simple public API (lib crate)
- Full test suite

In the Scheme/Lisp world the norm is for more implementations per
author than authors per implementation.
